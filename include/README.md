This header is not supported or endorsed by the collectd project: use it at own risk.
This is a API-compatible header built using snippets of headers from collectd daemon 5.6.0.
It is released under the same license of the collectd daemon, thus MIT license.
The purpose is to allow to build collectd plugins out of the main collectd source tree,
for development or experimentation purposes.
See the main README for details and installation instructions.
